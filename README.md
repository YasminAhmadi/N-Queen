# N Queen Problem
A simple GA algorithm is described as follows:
1. Create a random populattion of potential solutions consistng of n individuals
(initial populations).
2. Evaluate the fitness value f(x) of each individual, x, in the popula,on.
3. Repeat the following three steps to create a new popula,on until comple,on of the new popula,on.
4. Select two individuals of the current generation for ma,ng.
5. Apply crossover with a certain ratio to create offspring.
6. Apply mutation with a certain ratio.
7. The previous opera,ons are repeated until the completion criterion is met.
Instead of using a single mutation the muta,ons swap, inversion, dist and distplus were used.
